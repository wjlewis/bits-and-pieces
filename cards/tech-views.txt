# A Few Views on Technology

## Pseudo-Amish/Point of no Return

_Not to be confused with actual Amish practices._
All technology created before a certain date is useful and good.
At some point things took a turn for the worse, though.
That point might have been when the automobile was invented, or the combine
harvester, or the telephone, the smartphone, social media, or LLMs.

## Techno-Optimist/Dymaxion

Technology has, by-and-large, acted as a force for good in the history of
humanity.
Technology has the potential to solve most problems, including most of the
important problems.

## Techno-Pessimist

The antithesis of techno-optimism, and an extreme version of the Pseudo-Amish
stance.
Technology is _just bad_.
We never should have come down from the trees.

## Two Watersheds

The idea is due to Ivan Illich.
Most technological advancement passes through two "watersheds": after the first
it serves mankind; after the second this relationship is inverted, with mankind
serving it.
Examples include medicine, automation, and even more abstract things like
corporations.

## Complementary vs. Competing

This idea is due to David Krakauer.
It only applies to "cognitive artifacts", but these make up a greater and
greater proportion of new technology.
We can classify cognitive artifacts as _complementary_ or _competitive_.
Complementary artifacts help us develop new skills that remain with us even when
the artifact isn't.
Competitive artifacts are like prosthetics, helping us only while they are with
us.

A paper map is an example of a complementary artifact: it gives you an entirely
new perspective on your location with respect to your surroundings.
This is so easily taken for granted that it may seem trivial.

A GPS-powered navigation system (like Google Maps) is a competing artifact: if
your connection is lost or your battery runs out, _you might not even know what
state you're in_.

## Longer Lever

New technology is a longer lever, a force multiplier.
All classifications are an attempt to draw a line separating the good technology
from the bad.
But this line needs an explanation (e.g. complementary vs. competing) or we
won't take it seriously.
We'll consider it _arbitrary_.

But it may be that the best justification for using a barbell rather than a
weight machine is simply that the _barbell is better_.
Not that it's older, or not older, or between some watersheds, etc.
That it's simply better at helping you accomplish what you want to accomplish.

For the same reason it might be appropriate to travel by car in certain
situations but not appropriate in others.
Ditto for using a calculator or an LLM.
