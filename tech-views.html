All technology created before a certain date is useful and good.
At some point things took a turn for the worse, though.
That point might have been when the automobile was invented, or the combine
harvester, or the telephone, the smartphone, social media, or LLMs.</p><h2 id="Techno-Optimist/Dymaxion">Techno-Optimist/Dymaxion</h2><p>Technology has, by-and-large, acted as a force for good in the history of
humanity.
Technology has the potential to solve most problems, including most of the
important problems.</p><h2 id="Techno-Pessimist">Techno-Pessimist</h2><p>The antithesis of techno-optimism, and an extreme version of the Pseudo-Amish
stance.
Technology is <em>just bad</em>.
We never should have come down from the trees.</p><h2 id="Two-Watersheds">Two Watersheds</h2><p>The idea is due to Ivan Illich.
Most technological advancement passes through two <!-- -->“<!-- -->watersheds<!-- -->”<!-- -->: after the first
it serves mankind; after the second this relationship is inverted, with mankind
serving it.
Examples include medicine, automation, and even more abstract things like
corporations.</p><h2 id="Complementary-vs.-Competing">Complementary vs. Competing</h2><p>This idea is due to David Krakauer.
It only applies to <!-- -->“<!-- -->cognitive artifacts<!-- -->”<!-- -->, but these make up a greater and
greater proportion of new technology.
We can classify cognitive artifacts as <em>complementary</em> or <em>competitive</em>.
Complementary artifacts help us develop new skills that remain with us even when
the artifact isn&#x27;t.
Competitive artifacts are like prosthetics, helping us only while they are with
us.</p><p>A paper map is an example of a complementary artifact: it gives you an entirely
new perspective on your location with respect to your surroundings.
This is so easily taken for granted that it may seem trivial.</p><p>A GPS-powered navigation system (like Google Maps) is a competing artifact: if
your connection is lost or your battery runs out, <em>you might not even know what
state you&#x27;re in</em>.</p><h2 id="Longer-Lever">Longer Lever</h2><p>New technology is a longer lever, a force multiplier.
All classifications are an attempt to draw a line separating the good technology
from the bad.
But this line needs an explanation (e.g. complementary vs. competing) or we
won&#x27;t take it seriously.
We&#x27;ll consider it <em>arbitrary</em>.</p><p>But it may be that the best justification for using a barbell rather than a
weight machine is simply that the <em>barbell is better</em>.
Not that it&#x27;s older, or not older, or between some watersheds, etc.
That it&#x27;s simply better at helping you accomplish what you want to accomplish.</p><p>For the same reason it might be appropriate to travel by car in certain
situations but not appropriate in others.
Ditto for using a calculator or an LLM.</p></main></div>
